classic characters from 'Primal Rage' for this project as a sort of fan tribute.\n        While contemplating whether to utilize the original game sprites, I ultimately opted for a more personal approach by creating my own sprite sheets through illustration. \n        \n        In terms of code design, a significant decision involved isolating the Fighter class from the Main.py file due to its extensive codebase. \n        This separation not only contributes to a cleaner and more readable project structure but also simplifies the Main.py file, as now I only need to import the Fighter class for integration.\n        ",codeSnippet:a(471),codeExplain:"\n        Below is some code from my Fighter class for the two characters.\n        This class is initialized with various attributes,

first time using Pygame and I still have much to learn, I've come to realize that Pygame offers a robust toolkit beyond my initial expectations. \n\n        Engaging in this project has not only been a learning experience with Pygame but has also immersed me in the intricate mindset required to make a game functional. \n        It's a thrilling journey, and I look forward to further exploring and honing my skills in game development.\n        ",futurePlans:"\n        While this project remains a work in progress, it primarily served as my initiation into the realm of Pygame. \n\n        I do

specifies that token authentication is required, and the user must be authenticated to perform these actions. \n        The post method is responsible for creating a new Followship instance when a user initiates a follow action, while the delete method handles the removal of an existing Followship instance when a user decides to unfollow. \n        The username parameter in both methods is used to identify the user being followed or unfollowed.\n\n        It retrieves the current user (follower) from the request and fetches the user to be followed or unfollowed (following) using the username parameter. \n        Then it either creates a new Followship instance or deletes an existing one accordingly. \n        The class utilizes serializers to convert the Followship instances into JSON
