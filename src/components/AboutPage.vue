            Welcome to my portfolio! 
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Candace Andrews and I'm a junior software engineer with a
            background in digital art and design. I am able to offer a distinctive
            combination of both technical expertise and artistic insight. My journey
            into programming was sparked by a passion for video games, and I have since
            honed my skills in Python, Django, and JavaScript.
