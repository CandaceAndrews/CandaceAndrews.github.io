            Welcome to my portfolio!

        <p>
            My name is Candace Andrews and I'm a junior software engineer with a background in digital art and design. I am able to offer a distinctive combination of both technical expertise and artistic insight. My journey into programming was sparked by a passion for video games, and I have since honed my skills in Python, Django, and JavaScript.
