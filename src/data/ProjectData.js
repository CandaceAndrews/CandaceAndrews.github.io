        projectOverview: `
        This is an animal collection weather app that me and three other students made for our final project for Momentum. 
        The original title was ‘Is It Raining?’ and it was built to be a weather app for a target audience of users aged 10 and up.
        The hope was to create a ‘Pokemon Go’ type app that would combine weather conditions and creature collecting.
        It displays real-time weather updates pulled from the OpenWeatherMap API and generates a random animal to appear according to the day’s weather.
        Each animal had a set weather condition that they would appear during.
        The user could catch them and add them to their collection. Anyone can view the weather but to catch an animal and start a collection
        the user will have to create an account. After catching the same animal multiple times points are accumulated and the animal can transform into a ‘Mega Beast’.
        A user can only catch the same animal once every 12 hours. There are 47 unique creature designs for this project all illustrated by myself.
